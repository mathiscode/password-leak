## Introduction

`password-leak` is a JavaScript module that can be used to determine if a password is compromised by checking with the [Have I Been Pwned API](https://haveibeenpwned.com/API/).

## How is this safe?

Your passwords are **NEVER** transmitted to any other system. This library makes use of the [Have I Been Pwned API](https://haveibeenpwned.com/API/), which implements a [k-Anonymity Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-anonymity) so your password can be checked without ever having to give it to any other party.

## Installation

`npm install @mathiscode/password-leak@latest`

## Usage in Browser

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@mathiscode/password-leak@latest"></script>

<script>
  const isLeaked = await isPasswordLeaked('myPassword')
  const strength = await checkPasswordStrength('myPassword')
  console.log('Is leaked?', isLeaked)
  console.log('Strength', strength)
</script>
```

## Usage in Node.js

### With import/await

```js
import { isPasswordLeaked, checkPasswordStrength } from '@mathiscode/password-leak'

const isLeaked = await isPasswordLeaked('myPassword')
const strength = await checkPasswordStrength('myPassword')
console.log('Is leaked?', isLeaked)
console.log('Strength', strength)
```

### With require/sync

```js
const { checkPasswordStrength, isPasswordLeakedSync } = require('@mathiscode/password-leak')

isPasswordLeakedSync('myPassword', (error, isLeaked) => {
  if (error) throw new Error(error)
  console.log('Is leaked?', isLeaked)
})

const strength = checkPasswordStrength('myPassword')
console.log('Strength', strength)
```

## Usage in Command Line

Install globally:

```sh
npm install -g @mathiscode/password-leak
```

You can also use it without installing via npx:

```sh
npx @mathiscode/password-leak myPassword
```

You can then use it in two ways:

1. Interactive mode:

```sh
password-leak
```

2. Direct mode:

```sh
password-leak myPassword
```

The command will:

- Print whether the password has been compromised and its strength
- Exit with status code 0 if the password is safe
- Exit with status code 1 if the password is compromised or an error occurs

## Development

```sh
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/mathiscode/password-leak.git

pnpm install

# Build the project
pnpm run build

# Run the tests
pnpm run test

# Start the UI
pnpm run ui # demo at https://password-leak.vercel.app
